# ChessInPython
Here is a chess game written in Python utilising OOP.
There is a main file which is 2 players on 1 computer style gaming. Also there is ser.py which is a server (to be ran before clients). And client.py to run to connect to the server. 
client2.py is just to be able to test from the same computer the online capacity of the project on the local network level.
Cheers for checking it out <3
